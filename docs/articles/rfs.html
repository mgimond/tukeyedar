</h2>
<p>The <em>residual-fit spread plot</em> (rfs plot) is a plot first
introduced by William Cleveland designed to compare the variability
explained by a fitted model (such as group means for a univariate
analysis or a linear model for a bivariate analysis) and the variability
in the residuals. It’s constructed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A model is fitted to the data.</li>
<li>The residuals are computed by subtracting the fitted values from the
original values.</li>
<li>The estimated values from the model are centered on zero by
subtracting, for example, the mean from the values.</li>
<li>The centered fitted values and residuals are each sorted from
smallest to largest values.</li>
<li>Side-by-side plots are created by plotting the sorted fitted values
and residuals to their respective f-values (i.e. their fractional
contribution)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s start with a simple dataset where a batch of sixty
observations.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="rfs_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" alt="Figure 1. A batch of 60 values with the mean value represented as a red point. The points are jittered about the x-axis to help visualize their distribution." width="230.4"><p class="caption">
Figure 1. A batch of 60 values with the mean value represented as a red
point. The points are jittered about the x-axis to help visualize their
distribution.
</p>
</div>
<p>At best, we can estimate the expected value using some summary
statistic such as the mean (red point in figure 1)–11.03 in this working
example. This gives us quite a bit of variability in predicting
<code>y</code> given that the noise in the data covers a range of around
9, 13 or around 4 units.</p>
<p>If we want to improve our estimation of the value in <code>y</code>,
we may want to add a grouping variable to the mix. In Figure 2, we see
that the same set of values are now split across groups <code>a</code>,
<code>b</code> and <code>c</code>. Doing so, in this example, seems to
reduce the variability, or the “randomness” in our estimation of
<code>y</code>, given that by knowing which group <code>y</code> falls
into, we can come up with a more precise estimate of the value while
reducing the uncertainty associated with that estimate.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="rfs_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" alt="Figure 2. Same batch of values split across three groups with each group's mean displayed as a red point." width="220.8"><p class="caption">
Figure 2. Same batch of values split across three groups with each
group’s mean displayed as a red point.
</p>
</div>
<p>Eyeballing the three batches, it seems that the residuals in the data
are reduced down to around two units–an improvement in our estimation
since there is less uncertainty in the estimated value if we know which
group the value belongs to.</p>
<p>The uncertainty seems consistent across all three batches, but note
the outlier in batch <code>b</code> which may make it seem as though
batch <code>b</code> has greater variability in its residuals. This
brings up an issue as to how best to visualize the spread of the
residuals in the data. In the above figures, we are jittering the points
to help separate the observations, but this does not help us see how the
residuals are distributed. In other words, are they uniformly
distributed about the visible range of 2 units, or do they follow a bell
shaped curve? We could generated violin plots to help visualize the
distributions as shown in Figure 3.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="rfs_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" alt="Figure 3. Violin plots. Dashed lines show the mean values for each batch. The bisque colored inner region highlights where 50% of the residual values lie" width="384"><p class="caption">
Figure 3. Violin plots. Dashed lines show the mean values for each
batch. The bisque colored inner region highlights where 50% of the
residual values lie
</p>
</div>
<p>The bisque colored inner region in the Figure 3 violin plots
highlight where 50% of the mid values lie in the distributions. The
improvement in our ability to correctly estimate the mean values of
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> increases by quite a bit when
focusing on the inner 50% of residuals (2 units / 0.5 units = four fold
difference in spreads between estimates and residuals).</p>
<p>Now, if we choose to focus on the inner 95% of the residuals, the
difference in spreads between fitted values and residuals becomes a bit
more modest as can be seen in Figure 4.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="rfs_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" alt="Figure 4. Violin plots. The bisque colored inner region highlights where 95% of the residual values lie." width="384"><p class="caption">
Figure 4. Violin plots. The bisque colored inner region highlights where
95% of the residual values lie.
</p>
</div>
<p>Here, the residuals can span anywhere from 3 units (batch
<code>a</code>) to 4 units (batch <code>b</code>). On average, we can
say that the spread in residuals covers roughly 3.5 units. This makes
the spread in fitted values about half of the spread in residuals when
the latter is characterized as the mid 95% of residual values.</p>
<p>One can quickly see how our assessment of the value in adding a
grouping variable to the data can be biased based on what mid portion of
the residuals we should emphasize. For example, we probably don’t want
to focus on the full range since outliers may not be representative of
the full dataset. Conversely, the mid 50% of residuals may be too
restrictive. Ideally, we would want to have a plot that does not place
emphasis on a single measure of spread when comparing spreads between
fitted values and residuals. A Cleveland residual-fit spread plot (rfs
for short) does away with this shortcoming. Key elements of the plot
should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Placing emphasis on the spreads of the fitted values and not their
absolute values. This requires that the overall mean value be subtracted
from the fitted values to center the latter around zero (this aligns the
center of the fitted values with that of the residuals which are
centered around zero by design).</li>
<li>Order the fitted values and the residuals based on their respective
ranks. This facilitates the comparison of a wide range of measures of
spreads such as the 50% or 95% spreads used in the earlier
examples.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above criteria can be satisfied by making use of side-by-side
quantile plots where a quantile plot of the fitted values (minus the
global mean) is paired up with a quantile plot of the residuals. The
residual-fit spread plot for the working example is shown in figure
5.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="rfs_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" alt="Figure 5. A residual-fit spread plot.

The x-axis displays the fraction of values (f-value) in each plot that are at or below the matching value on the y-axis." width="480"><p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>What looks to be three horizontal lines on the left plot in Figure 5
are simply overlapping points–one point for each observation. Since an
observation falls into one of the three groups, many observations will
share the same fitted value. The rfs plot makes it easy to see that the
spread in fitted mean values covers a range of 2 units on the y-axis.
The right plot is constructed from the residuals for each observation
(this is part of the observation value not explained by its fitted
mean).</p>
<p>For example, the last observation in the original dataset has a value
of <code>11.05</code> and is part of group <code>c</code>. Its value can
be decomposed into its group mean of 11.98 and its residual of ‘-0.93’
as follows:</p>
<span class="math display">\[
11.05 = 11.98 - 0.93
\]</span>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="rfs_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" alt="Figure 6. Green point has a value of 11.05. It's decomposed into its group mean of 11.98 and its residual of -0.93. " width="268.8"><p class="caption">

</div>
<p>That observation’s mean and residual values are highlighted as green
points in Figure 6.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="rfs_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" alt="Figure 7. The  last observation is split between it fitted mean (centered on 0) and its residual. " width="480"><p class="caption">
Figure 7. The last observation is split between it fitted mean (centered
on 0) and its residual.
</p>
</div>
<p>The same process is applied to all other observations resulting in
the same number of points in both plots as total number of observations
in the batch.</p>
<p>The rfs plot facilitates the comparison of both spreads by sharing
the same y axis and by having both spreads centered on 0. In this
working example, the spreads are about identical suggesting that the
grouping variable can help explain some of the variability in the
data.</p>
<p>To help develop an intuitive feel for the interpretation of the plot,
we can explore two extreme scenarios. In this first scenario, we
generate a dataset where much of the variability in the data can be
explained by the fitted model. Figure 8 shows a plot of such a dataset.
Note the tight spread in residuals around each fitted means.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="rfs_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" alt="Figure 8. Another example." width="230.4"><p class="caption">
Figure 8. Another example.
</p>
</div>
<p>Figure 9 shows the matching rfs plot.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="rfs_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" alt="Figure 9. The spread in the fitted mean values spans 2 units along the y-axis. The residuals span less than 0.5 units suggesting that the fitted mean values do a good job in estimating the values in y." width="480"><p class="caption">
Figure 9. The spread in the fitted mean values spans 2 units along the
y-axis. The residuals span less than 0.5 units suggesting that the
fitted mean values do a good job in estimating the values in y.
</p>
</div>
<p>The groups do a really good job in predicting a value <code>y</code>
if the observation’s group is known since the error surrounding each
group estimate is small relative to the spread or differences in the
fitted mean values. In other words, an observation associated with a
group is very unlikely to be confused with a value from another group
given the large spread between group means versus the spread in the
residuals or uncertainty surrounding an observation in each group.</p>
<p>In this next example, we look at the other extreme: one where the
spread in fitted means is small relative to the uncertainty surrounding
each fitted value:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="rfs_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" alt="Figure 10. Another example." width="230.4"><p class="caption">
Figure 10. Another example.
</p>
</div>
<p>The rfs plot of the data is shown in Figure 11.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="rfs_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" alt="Figure 11. " width="480"><p class="caption">
Figure 11.
</p>
</div>
<p>With this last dataset, the spread in residuals is quite important
relative to the spread in fitted values. This suggests that the grouping
variables do not have a large effect in predicting a value
<code>y</code> given that the uncertainty in its value can make it
comparable to another group’s value.</p>
