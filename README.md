# tukeyedar

The `tukeyedar` package houses a subset of functions used in Exploratory
Data Analysis (EDA). Most functions are inspired by work published by
Tukey (1977), D. C. Hoaglin and Tukey (1983) and Velleman and Hoaglin
(1981). Note that this package is in beta mode, so use at your own
discretion. Many of the plots generated from these functions are not
necessarily geared for publication but are designed to focus the
viewer’s attention on the patterns generated by the plots (hence the
reason for light colored axes and missing axes labels for some of the
plots ).

The functions available in this package include:

|       Function | Description                                                                           |
|---------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    `eda_boxls` | Parallel boxplots with level and spread equalization                                  |
|    `eda_ltrim` | Trim lower values of a vector                                                         |
|    `eda_rtrim` | Trim upper values of a vector                                                         |
| `eda_ltrim_df` | Trim lower records of a dataframe                                                     |
| `eda_rtrim_df` | Trim upper records of a dataframe                                                     |
|       `eda_re` | Re-express using Tukey powers or Box-Cox transformation                               |
|     `eda_lsum` | Letter value summaries                                                                |
|       `eda_sl` | Spread-level funcion                                                                  |
|       `eda_lm` | Generate scatter plot along with regression line and LOESS curve                      |
|      `eda_3pt` | Generate 3-point summary of data and plot half-slopes                                 |
|   `eda_unipow` | Generate matrix of re-expressed univariate values based on ladder of powers           |
|    `eda_bipow` | Generate matrix of re-expressed bivariate values and plot 3-point summary half-slopes |
|    `eda_rline` | Fit a three-group resistant line to bivariate data                                    |

## Installation

This package can be installed from github (the installation process
makes use of the `devtools` package).

``` r
devtools::install_github("mgimond/tukeyedar")
```

Note that the vignettes will not be automatically generated with the
above command; note too that the vignettes are available on this website
(see next section). If you want a local version of the vignettes, add
the `build_vignettes = TRUE` parameter.

``` r
devtools::install_github("mgimond/tukeyedar", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

The vignette will require that `dplyr` be installed since the `eda_sl`
function relies on it. If `dplyr` is not already installed, the
aforementioned syntax will automatically install it for you.

If for some reason the vignettes are not created, you might want to
re-install the package with the `force=TRUE` parameter.

``` r
devtools::install_github("mgimond/tukeyedar", build_vignettes = TRUE, force=TRUE)
```

## Read the vignettes!

It’s strongly recommended that you read the vignettes. These can be
accessed from this website:

-   [An introduction to the
    functions](https://mgimond.github.io/tukeyedar/articles/Introduction.html)
-   [A detailed rundown of the resistant line
    function](https://mgimond.github.io/tukeyedar/articles/RLine.html)

If you chose to have the vignettes locally created when you installed
the package, then you can view them locally via
`vignette("Introduction", package = "tukeyedar")` and
`vignette("RLine", package = "tukeyedar")`. If you use a dark themed
IDE, the vignettes may not render very well so you might opt to view
them in a web browser via the functions
`RShowDoc("Introduction", package = "tukeyedar")` and
`RShowDoc("RLine", package = "tukeyedar")`.

## Using the functions

All functions start with `eda_`. For example, to generate a three point
summary plot of the `mpg` vs. `disp` from the `mtcars` dataset, type:

``` r
library(tukeyedar)
eda_3pt(mtcars, disp, mpg)
```

    #> [1] -0.1117241
    #> 
    #> $slope2
    #> [1] -0.0220894

    #> 
    #> $ymed
    #> [1] 27.30 19.20 14.95

Note that most functions are *pipe* friendly. For example:

``` r
# Using R >= 4.1
mtcars |>  eda_3pt(disp, mpg)

# Using magrittr (or any of the tidyverse packages)
library(magrittr)
mtcars %>% eda_3pt(disp, mpg)
```
